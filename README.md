# CR_Elections_BlockChain
"CR Elections Using Blockchain" was a Project which I did in 2nd Semester of my B. Tech Course as an Assignment in DSA Course. In this project, I created a C++ program in order to conduct CR (Class Representative / Monitor) Elections for our next Semester. 

In this project/program, I stored the Information (Name and Roll Number) of the CR Candidates and the Voters in two separates Block Chains respectively. In both Block Chains every Block was used to store the information of exactly one individual. In order to store information of an individual a separate Block was created and while creating the Block the System has to "Mine" the block (just like normal cryptocurrency mining) after which the new Block, with the designated information of the individual, was created and the System earns some amount of cryptocurrency - "Saur Coins". 

Now, using this Block Chain as a List the elections are performed : each Voter one by one casts their respective votes to their favourite CR candidate.

After every Individual has casted their vote, the top 3 most voted Candidates will be the winner of election and will be declared as New CR for the next Semester!
